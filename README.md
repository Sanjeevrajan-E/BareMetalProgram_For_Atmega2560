# BareMetalProgram_For_Atmega2560
Bare-metal GPIO programming on Arduino Mega (ATmega2560) without Arduino libraries. Includes low-level control of LEDs, 7-segment displays, keypad matrices, switches, and LED dot matrices. Ideal for learning register-level I/O handling and embedded system fundamentals.

This repository contains wokwi project links which contain source code and schematic .The projects are done for assignments in embedded software course provided by www.etalvis.com.,visit the website for the practical questions and knowledge of embedded systems.
